# Naval Warfare - Battleship Game

Welcome to **Naval Warfare**, a Battleship game built with JavaScript, Webpack, and tested using Jest.

## Project Overview

Naval Warfare is an implementation of the classic Battleship game. Players compete by taking turns to attack each other's fleets hidden on a gameboard. Ships are placed randomly, and the goal is to sink all of the opponent's ships before they sink yours.

## Key Features

- **Player vs Computer:** Play against a computer opponent with randomized ship placements and attacks.
- **Real-time Feedback:** Get immediate feedback on hits, misses, and ship sinking.
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Ships are placed dynamically, ensuring each game provides a different challenge.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript:** The core logic of the game is written in modern ES6+ JavaScript.
- **Webpack:** We utilized Webpack for module bundling and building the project.
- **Sass:** The project is styled using Sass for enhanced CSS features and maintainability.
- **Jest:** The game's logic, particularly the gameboard and player functionalities, are rigorously tested using Jest.

## What We Learned

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Writing tests in Jest helped ensure the correctness of game logic and improved development flow.
2. **Modular Programming:** By using ES6 modules, the code is broken down into manageable, reusable components.
3. **Webpack Configuration:** Setting up and configuring Webpack for bundling JavaScript, handling stylesheets, and preparing for production deployment.
4. **GitHub Pages Deployment:** Deploying a JavaScript application directly from a GitHub repository to GitHub Pages.
5. **Babel and ES6+:** Understanding the benefits of Babel and modern JavaScript features in building scalable projects.

## How to Play

1. **Game Start:** Once the game loads, the computer places ships randomly on the gameboard.
2. **Player Turns:** You take turns attacking by selecting coordinates. The computer responds with its own attack.
3. **End Game:** The game ends when one player's entire fleet has been destroyed. Victory or defeat is displayed.
